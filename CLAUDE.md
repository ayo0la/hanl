# Project Rules

## Git Commit Rules

- **No Claude signatures**: Never include `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or any Claude/AI attribution in commit messages.
- **Pull before push**: Always `git pull` before pushing to ensure the branch is up to date.
- **Past tense**: Write commit descriptions in past tense.
